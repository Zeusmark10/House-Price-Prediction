We perform EDA using pandas and the build a model using Sklearn and Linear Regression. Then we write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
We use html,css and javascript to build the website so that user can enter input such as Total sq.ft, area, bhk and bath. This model is then deployed using AWS EC2 instance.
